# OP-TEE Sample Applications
# Differences to upstream
This git contains altered versions of the original examples found at https://github.com/linaro-swg/optee_examples. The example applications acipher, aes and hello_world contain some of the example files of mbedtls/psa.
These example files contain slight changes, with comments about them and contain wrappers, which allows this altered mbedtls/psa code to run on a native OP-TEE environment.

# Original ReadMe
This git contains source code for sample host and Trusted Application that can
be used directly in the OP-TEE project.

All official OP-TEE documentation has moved to http://optee.readthedocs.io. The
information that used to be here in this git can be found under
[optee_examples].
